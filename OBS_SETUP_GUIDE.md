## Step 3: Live Performance Workflow

3. Use the play button or spacebar to start displaying
4. Navigate through lyrics using arrow keys or buttons
5. The display in OBS updates instantly

### Advanced Tips

- **Preview**: Use the preview panel to see exactly what's displayed
- **Smooth Transitions**: Lines fade in/out for professional appearance

## Step 4: OBS Scene Setup Recommendations

### Basic Lyrics Scene
- Add the browser source
- Position it in the lower third of the screen
- Use a semi-transparent background for readability

### Full-Screen Lyrics Scene
- Make the browser source cover the entire screen
- Use for worship services or karaoke-style displays
- Consider adding your logo in a corner

### Picture-in-Picture
- Resize the browser source to a corner
- Perfect for live streams where you want lyrics visible but not dominant

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Ensure the application is running (`npm run dev`)
- Check that the URL in OBS matches the one shown in the control panel
- Look for the green "Connected" indicator in the control panel

### Display Not Updating
- Refresh the browser source in OBS (right-click â†’ Refresh)
- Check that lyrics are loaded and "Play" is activated
- Verify the WebSocket connection is active

### Performance Optimization
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Use a dedicated computer for OBS if possible
- Consider lowering the refresh rate if needed

## Integration with Other Software

The application works with any software that supports browser sources:
- **OBS Studio**: Primary recommendation
- **Streamlabs OBS**: Use browser source
- **XSplit**: Add web page source
- **vMix**: Add web browser input
- **Any streaming software**: That supports HTML/web content

## Custom Styling (Advanced)

You can add custom CSS in the OBS browser source settings for additional styling:

```css
/* Example: Add text shadow for better readability */
body {
  text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.8);
}

/* Example: Custom font */
body {
  font-family: 'Arial Black', sans-serif;
}
```

Your lyrics display system is now ready for professional use in OBS!
